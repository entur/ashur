/**
 * MDCCleanupProcessor is a Camel processor that cleans up the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)
 * by removing the correlation ID and codespace after processing is complete.
 *
 * This is typically used in the onCompletion phase of a Camel route to ensure that
 * the MDC context does not retain information from previous messages, preventing potential
 * information leakage or confusion in subsequent log entries.
